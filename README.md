# Loan-Calculate-Program
This is a basic Program that calculates the parameters involving a loan. The 4 parameters involved are cost(c), years(y), 
months(m), and rate(r). The user inputs values for 3 of the parameters. The program assumes that the user entered zero for the
the remaining parameters and calculates the value of that parameter based on the other 3 parameters.
